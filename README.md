## Running the Application

To run the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. In the project directory, open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the app in development mode.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

   The page will automatically reload if you make any edits to the code. Additionally, any lint errors will be displayed in the console.
